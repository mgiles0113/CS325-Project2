Compiling

The program is written in C++ and is self-contained in the single file called 'project2.c'. 
In order to compile, simply use the G++ compiler to produce the executable file. 
The zipped package contains 1 file: - project2.cpp - the primary C++ source code file.

In order to compile the program, unzip the files and navigate to the folder they are in and type
the following command on the command line: g++ project2.cpp -o project2

Running

The previous command will produce the executable file called project1. On the same command line prompt, 
type:
project2 [input.txt]
This will run the program and all output is directed to the file called [inputchange.txt]

Modifications

In order to change the input, provide various combinations of arrays in the input.txt file.
